Similar to project 1 and 2, I put the bash script in the 'src' directory.
Change to that directory and run the script from there. The test file given 
to us is in the same directory "src". For example, this worked for me:
 
    xex967@fox02:~/NetBeansProjects/project3/src$ bash project3.sh

Thanks for reading this and have a great day!
